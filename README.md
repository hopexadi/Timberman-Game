# 🌲 Timberman Game

A simple clone of the classic Timberman arcade game built with **C++** and **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, sprite handling, real-time input, and collision mechanics in a fun, interactive way.

## 🎮 Game Overview

In this game, you play as a lumberjack chopping a never-ending tree. You must avoid branches and switch sides (left/right) to survive. The more you chop, the higher your score. However, you’re racing against time – so chop fast or it's game over!
